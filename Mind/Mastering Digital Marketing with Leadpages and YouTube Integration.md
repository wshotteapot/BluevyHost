## Features of Leadpages

Although Leadpages is primarily known as a landing page builder, its range of tools and features positions it as much more than that. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of its most notable capabilities:

### 1. Professionally Designed Templates

Leadpages provides access to a vast library of tested, high-converting templates that are fully optimized for desktop and mobile users. With its drag-and-drop editor, you can easily customize templates to match your brandâ€™s identity and campaign goals. You donâ€™t even need a website to publish your landing pageâ€”just design, customize, and launch!

### 2. LeadBoxes for Advanced Lead Capture

LeadBoxes are customizable pop-ups that help you capture leads anywhere on your website or blog. These pop-ups can be triggered by clicking buttons, images, or even on a timer. One standout feature is the **Exit LeadBox**, which appears when visitors attempt to leave your page. This is an excellent opportunity to present them with irresistible offers or valuable content.

### 3. Native Ad Creation

Another standout feature is Leadpagesâ€™ ability to create **Facebook** and **Instagram ads** directly within the platform. The software automatically pulls content from your landing pages, allowing you to create targeted, professional-quality ads in minutes. Leadpages even integrates with Facebook Pixel to track campaign performance and retarget leads for maximum ROI.

### 4. Split Testing for Optimization

Leadpagesâ€™ built-in split testing (A/B testing) tool enables you to compare different versions of your landing pages. This feature allows you to identify which designs and elements drive higher conversions, empowering you to continuously optimize your campaigns for better results.

### 5. Integrations for Seamless Workflows

Leadpages seamlessly integrates with a variety of marketing tools, including popular email marketing platforms, CRMs, and more. For instance:
- Connect with email marketing tools to capture leads and add them directly to your automated sequences.
- Use Shopify integration to create a fully functional e-commerce landing page with built-in shopping carts and buy buttons.
