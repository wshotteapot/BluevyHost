## Features of Leadpages

While Leadpages is primarily known as a landing page builder, its extensive features go far beyond this, making it a versatile tool for all your marketing needs. Here are some of its core capabilities:

### 1. Professionally Designed Templates

Leadpages comes with a library of tested, high-converting templates tailored to boost your business results. These templates are mobile-friendly, ensuring a seamless user experience across devices. Customizing templates is incredibly simpleâ€”just drag and drop elements to align with your brand and campaign goals. You can even publish your landing pages without needing a separate website!

### 2. LeadBoxes for Targeted Lead Capture

One standout feature is **LeadBoxes**â€”pop-ups designed to collect leads on your digital assets, such as blogs or websites. LeadBoxes can be triggered in various ways, such as by clicking a button or image. Additionally, you can configure LeadBoxes to appear based on timing or user behavior, such as exit intent, to capture leads before they leave your page.

### 3. Native Ad Creation

Another incredible feature of Leadpages is its ability to create Facebook and Instagram ads directly within the platform. The software pulls content from your landing pages, allowing you to quickly and efficiently generate ads optimized to drive traffic. Leadpages also automatically integrates with Facebook Pixel to track and retarget leads effectively.

### 4. Split Testing

With **split testing** (A/B testing), marketers can test different landing page elements side by side to see which design converts better. This feature helps you make data-driven decisions and continuously optimize your campaigns for maximum effectiveness.

### 5. Integrations

Leadpages integrates seamlessly with top marketing and sales tools, including email marketing platforms and CRM systems. For example, it connects with platforms like Klick Tipp to automate email follow-ups and Shopify to handle seamless sales processes. With more than 40 direct integrations and access to 1,000+ apps via Zapier, Leadpages easily fits into your existing workflow.
