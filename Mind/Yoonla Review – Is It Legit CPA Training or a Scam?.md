# Yoonla Review â€“ Is It Legit CPA Training or a Scam?

## Overview: What Is Yoonla?

Yoonla is an online learning platform that focuses on CPA (Cost Per Action) and affiliate marketing.

Through Yoonla, users learn to promote the Foundation System via email marketing and landing pages as part of a marketing funnel.

While the affiliate program is free to join and doesn't require payment details, monetizing the system requires upfront investments.

## Is Yoonla Legit or a Scam?

Yoonla is a legitimate training program designed to teach beginners about CPA and affiliate marketing. Its free training provides real value, and the skills learned can be applied to other ventures. However, the reliance on paid advertising and potential funnel saturation make it less ideal for those seeking free traffic methods.

If you're willing to invest in tools and advertising, Yoonla can be a great starting point. However, for beginners on a tight budget, exploring free traffic generation strategies might be a better option.
